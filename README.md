# Mini_Research_Proposal

As a final assignment in "Introduction to Department Research" course at the Technion institute,
I've written a mini research proposal, with the guidance of Prof. Kimelfeld.

My mini paper "Committee Voting with Incomplete Approval Under Constraints" discuss incomplete databases and voting rules over those.
I'm doing a review of committees' voting rules, its' computational hardness and introduce a new term "F-Dependent committee", which later induce the terms "F-Dependent necessary committee" and "F-Dependent possible committee".

I've decided not to pursue this path of research in the databases field due to my big interest in ML. yet, it was a great experience for me.
